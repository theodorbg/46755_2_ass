Wind Production Impact in One-Price Balancing Optimization
Analysis of "All-or-Nothing" Strategy
You've observed that the optimal strategy is indeed "all-or-nothing" (either 0 or full capacity), and you're right to question whether the forecasted wind production is even considered in the optimization.

How Wind Production Is Used
Looking at your optimization function:

# Wind production, day-ahead price, and balancing price
wind_actual = scenario.loc[h, 'wind']
price_DA = scenario.loc[h, 'price']
price_BAL = scenario.loc[h, 'balancing_price']

# Profit calculation
profit_expr.addTerms(price_DA, p_DA[h])  # Day-ahead revenue
profit_expr.addConstant(price_BAL * wind_actual)  # Constant term
profit_expr.addTerms(-price_BAL, p_DA[h])  # Variable term

The wind production is considered in each scenario, but in a one-price balancing scheme, it doesn't directly influence the optimal offering decision. Here's why:

Mathematical Explanation
When we rearrange the profit equation:

profit = price_DA * p_DA + price_BAL * (wind_actual - p_DA)
       = (price_DA - price_BAL) * p_DA + price_BAL * wind_actual

The decision variable p_DA is multiplied by (price_DA - price_BAL). This means:

If price_DA > price_BAL: Bid full capacity (500 MW)
If price_DA < price_BAL: Bid zero (0 MW)
If price_DA = price_BAL: Any bid gives the same profit
The actual wind production (wind_actual) only affects the constant term, not the decision itself.

Intuitive Explanation
In a one-price balancing scheme:

If day-ahead prices are higher: You want to sell as much as possible day-ahead
If balancing prices are higher: You want to sell as little as possible day-ahead and sell everything in the balancing market
This explains the "all-or-nothing" strategy you're observing.

Your implementation is correct - the wind production forecast is considered in the profit calculation for each scenario, but doesn't directly drive the bidding strategy due to the structure of the one-price balancing scheme.


Balancing Market Schemes and Penalties
You've touched on an important distinction between one-price and two-price balancing schemes!

Current Implementation: One-Price Scheme
In your current code (Step 1.1), you're using a one-price balancing scheme, where:

All imbalances are settled at the same balancing price (λ^B)
There's no explicit penalty for over-offering or under-offering
The profit calculation is:
This explains your "all-or-nothing" result, because:

If λ^DA > λ^B: Offer maximum capacity
If λ^DA < λ^B: Offer nothing
What You're Describing: Two-Price Scheme
The scenario you're describing is a two-price balancing scheme (coming in Step 1.2), where:

Deficit penalty (when W < p^DA):

You're penalized for delivering less than offered
You pay a higher price (λ^def) for your deficit
Surplus compensation (when W > p^DA):

You're compensated for delivering more than offered
You receive a lower price (λ^sur) for your surplus
The profit calculation would be:

Impact on Strategy
In a two-price scheme, you'll see more nuanced offering strategies because:

Overly optimistic offers are penalized
Overly conservative offers have limited upside
This will eliminate the all-or-nothing strategy and result in offers that more closely match expected wind production.

The introduction of the two-price scheme in Step 1.2 will address exactly the concerns you've raised!
